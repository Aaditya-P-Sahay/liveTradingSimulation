   - Verifies cash calculation
   - Verifies PNL = (short_price - cover_price) × quantity
   - Verifies trade recording

   - Verifies loss calculation
   - Verifies negative PNL handling
   - Verifies final wealth reduction

   - Verifies net PNL calculation
   - Verifies all positions closed
   - Verifies total cash impact

### Contest Reset Tests (5 scenarios)
1. ✅ Trades cleared on contest stop

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations ⚠️ REQUIRED

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run the script: `backend/database_migrations.sql`

**This is CRITICAL** - Without it, leaderboard storage won't work.

### Step 2: Test Everything

```powershell
# Run all tests
cd backend
npm test

# Should see:
# ✓ Auto square-off tests (3 passed)
# ✓ Contest reset tests (5 passed)
# ✓ All other tests (passed)
```

### Step 3: Manual Testing

Follow the guide in `QUICKSTART.md` to:
1. Start a contest
2. Make trades (including short sells)
3. Stop contest
4. Verify auto square-off worked
5. Verify data cleared
6. Start new contest
7. Verify fresh 1M cash
