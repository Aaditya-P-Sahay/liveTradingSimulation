## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Phase 1: Database Setup
- [ ] Open Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to SQL Editor
- [ ] Copy entire contents of `backend/database_migrations.sql`
- [ ] Paste into SQL Editor

- [ ] Confirm `current_leaderboard` column exists in `contest_state` table
- [ ] Confirm 7 new indexes created
- [ ] Confirm 3 new views created
- [ ] Confirm 2 new functions created

### Phase 2: Code Review
- [ ] Review changes in `backend/index.js`
- [ ] Confirm `clearContestData()` function exists (lines 126-219)
- [ ] Confirm `stopContest()` properly calls auto square-off (lines 535-608)
- [ ] Confirm `updateLeaderboard()` stores to DB (lines 1110-1150)

#### 5.4 Auto Square-Off Test
- [ ] Either: Wait for contest to end (60 minutes) OR manually stop contest
- [ ] Backend logs show: "🔄 Auto-squaring off N short positions..."
- [ ] For each short position:
  - [ ] Logs show: "📊 SYMBOL: Short@₹X Cover@₹Y P&L=₹Z"
  - [ ] Logs show: "💰 user@email: Cash ₹A → ₹B"
- [ ] Logs show: "✅ Auto squared-off N positions"
- [ ] Check database:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM short_positions WHERE is_active = false;
  ```
  - [ ] All shorts marked inactive
- [ ] Check portfolio cash:
  - [ ] Cash reduced by cover cost
  - [ ] Realized PNL updated
  - [ ] Short value = 0

#### 5.5 Final Leaderboard

  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM short_positions;  -- Should be 0
  SELECT cash_balance, total_wealth FROM portfolio LIMIT 5;
  -- All should be 1,000,000
  ```
- [ ] Verify cleanup summary shows correct counts

#### 5.7 New Contest Fresh Start
- [ ] Start a new contest
- [ ] Login as the same user who traded before
- [ ] Verify portfolio shows:
  - [ ] cash_balance = 1,000,000
  - [ ] holdings = {} (empty)

### Phase 6: Edge Case Testing

#### 6.1 Multiple Shorts
- [ ] Start contest
- [ ] Short sell 2 different stocks
- [ ] Stop contest
- [ ] Verify both shorts squared off
- [ ] Verify total PNL is sum of both shorts
- [ ] Verify cash updated correctly

#### 6.2 Profit Scenario
- [ ] Short sell stock at ₹2,500
- [ ] If price drops to ₹2,400 before contest ends
- [ ] Auto square-off should show:
  - [ ] PNL = (2500 - 2400) × quantity = PROFIT
  - [ ] Cash = initial + short_proceeds - cover_cost > initial
  - [ ] Total wealth increased

#### 6.3 Loss Scenario
- [ ] Short sell stock at ₹2,500
- [ ] If price rises to ₹2,600 before contest ends
- [ ] Auto square-off should show:
  - [ ] PNL = (2500 - 2600) × quantity = LOSS
  - [ ] Cash = initial + short_proceeds - cover_cost < initial
  - [ ] Total wealth decreased

#### 6.4 Mixed Holdings and Shorts
- [ ] Buy 100 shares of Stock A
- [ ] Short 50 shares of Stock A (same stock!)
- [ ] Verify portfolio calculations:
  - [ ] Long position value calculated
  - [ ] Short unrealized PNL calculated
  - [ ] Total wealth = cash + long_value + short_unrealized_pnl
  - [ ] No double-counting

### Phase 7: Performance Testing

#### 7.1 Database Performance
- [ ] Check index usage:
  ```sql
  SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan
  FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
  WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
  ```
- [ ] Verify new indexes being used

#### 7.2 Leaderboard Performance
- [ ] With 10+ users in portfolio table
- [ ] Request leaderboard via API: `GET /api/leaderboard`
- [ ] Should return in < 500ms
- [ ] Check Supabase logs for slow queries

#### 7.3 Memory Usage
- [ ] Let contest run for full 60 minutes
- [ ] Monitor backend process memory
- [ ] Should not continuously increase (no memory leaks)
- [ ] After contest stop, memory should be released

### Phase 8: Error Handling

#### 8.1 Contest Already Running
- [ ] Start contest
- [ ] Try to start again
- [ ] Should return: "Contest already running"
- [ ] No errors in backend

#### 8.2 Contest Not Running
- [ ] Try to stop contest when not running
- [ ] Should return: "Contest not running"
- [ ] No errors

#### 8.3 Invalid Trades
- [ ] Try to trade when contest not running
- [ ] Should fail with appropriate message
- [ ] Try to buy with insufficient cash
- [ ] Should fail with "Insufficient cash balance"
- [ ] Try to short sell when contest stopped
- [ ] Should fail appropriately

### Phase 9: Frontend Integration

#### 9.1 Real-time Updates
- [ ] Portfolio updates automatically when price changes
- [ ] Leaderboard updates every 30 seconds
- [ ] Contest progress bar shows correct %
- [ ] Contest timer counts down properly

#### 9.2 WebSocket Connection
- [ ] Check browser console for WebSocket connection
- [ ] Should see: "WebSocket connected"

- [ ] Should receive leaderboard_update events every 30 seconds

#### 9.3 Contest End Notification
- [ ] When contest ends, frontend shows notification
- [ ] Final leaderboard displayed
- [ ] Winner announced (if applicable)

### Phase 10: Documentation Review
- [ ] Read `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - understand all changes

## 🐛 If Something Fails

### Tests Failing?
1. Check `.env` file has correct Supabase credentials
2. Verify database migrations were applied
3. Check Supabase table structure matches schema
4. Clear test data: Run cleanup queries in Supabase

### Auto Square-Off Not Working?
1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify short positions exist: `SELECT * FROM short_positions WHERE is_active = true;`
3. Check current prices in `contestState.latestPrices`
4. Verify `stopContest()` function is being called

### Data Not Clearing?
1. Check backend logs during contest stop
2. Verify `clearContestData()` is called
3. Manually run: `SELECT * FROM cleanup_contest_data();` in Supabase
4. Check for database permission errors

### Leaderboard Not Stored?
1. Verify `current_leaderboard` column exists
2. Check database migrations were applied
3. Look for errors in `updateLeaderboard()` function logs
